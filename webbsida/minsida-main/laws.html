        Upphovsr√§tt<br>
        Music, images, paintings, photographs, texts, computer games, sculptures can all be protected by copyright, if they are sufficiently original. 
        The creator of the work becomes the author and the right arises automatically when the work is created. If the work is considered good or bad does not matter, it is 
        the originality that counts. One good thing about this is that people have the freedom to use pictures that belong to other people as long as you put you own creative twist to it.
        On the other hand, the work that has been put in these my the creators might be undermined because the person who put a creative twist on it can call it theirs,
        furthermore sometimes very little creative twist is needed to call something yours which will further impact the creator negatively.

        LEK<br>
        The law covers the concept of electronic communication of all types of electronic communication networks such as the telecommunications network, the Internet and the cable TV network. The law created a uniform and technology-neutral legislation for all electronic communications to meet the fact that products and services in the area are becoming increasingly independent of platform.
